# Audio Recording System Using PyAudio
Implemented an audio recording system using PyAudio, which allows users to record audio and play it back. The system is divided into two Python scripts:

1. record.py: This script handles the audio recording functionality. It captures audio input from the user's microphone and saves it as a .wav file.

2. playfile.py: This script is responsible for playing back the recorded audio. It reads the .wav file created by the record.py script and plays it through the user's speakers.
